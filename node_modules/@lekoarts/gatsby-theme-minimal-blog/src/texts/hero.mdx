Probably like you, I'm that person 
who is constantly coming up with lots of project ideas and things I want to learn. 
Whether that be ideas for apps, websites, businesses; whatever. 
My notebook is filled with so many ideas, places to vist, games to play, books to read 
but never get the time to work on them.

The problem is I never seem to get round to completing them, or even starting them for that matter. The list just grows bigger and bigger.

Not completing any of these ideas comes with a few problems:

The list grows bigger and more daunting
I feel like a failure because I'm not completing anything
Missing out on exploring cool ideas with massive potential

I don't want to live in a life full of regrets, so I decided to create this stie.
The goal of this website is to try and explore as many of these ideas as I can. 
If they can make some money too, that'd be great.
